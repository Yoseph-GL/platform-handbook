# Platform Engineering Handbook: Documentation as Code

**Joseph Angel Anthony Garza Lopez | Aspiring Platform Engineer**  
Aspiring Platform Engineer focused on Backend Infrastructure and DataOps.  
Building scalable, automated environments through code-driven documentation.

## About & Tags

**Description:** "Production-ready Platform Engineering handbook using Documentation as Code. Deep dives into Java OOP, SQL optimization, Bash automation, and Docker on Linux."  
**Status:** Early-stage — the SQL guide is the most developed section. Other domains are scaffolded and pending content.  
**Topics:** platform-engineering, dataops, documentation-as-code, java-oop, sql-optimization, bash-scripting, docker, linux-administration.

## Knowledge Map

| Domain | Focus | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-Systems` | Linux/Ubuntu internals, TCP/IP, DNS, and security hardening | [01-Systems](./01-Systems) |
| `02-Development` | Java OOP, Python, data structures, and SQL optimization | [02-Development](./02-Development) |
| `03-Infrastructure` | Docker, orchestration fundamentals, and CI/CD principles | [03-Infrastructure](./03-Infrastructure) |
| `04-Operations` | LTS-ready scripts and SOPs for production operations | [04-Operations](./04-Operations) |

## Core Technical Domains: Java, SQL, and Linux Systems

This handbook prioritizes backend engineering fundamentals with production context: object-oriented system design in Java, relational modeling and SQL tuning, and Linux-first operational literacy.

## Infrastructure Automation with Docker and Bash

Infrastructure content is organized for repeatable automation patterns that scale from local validation to CI/CD execution, with explicit focus on deterministic Bash behavior and container-first workflows.

## LTS Standards: Safety and Scalability in Ops

Operations notes and scripts are designed for maintainability under long-term support constraints, with controlled execution paths and explicit safeguards for production-grade reliability.

## The LTS Promise

The LTS Promise: All automation scripts and code snippets in this repository are LTS-ready. They implement set -euo pipefail for shell safety, use absolute path anchoring, and strictly require the --run flag for any system-modifying execution to ensure reliability in production-grade environments.
